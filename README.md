CVFeatureFinder
===============

This program uses the OpenCV libraries to perform feature detection, description, and matching between two sets of images, or an image and a video feed, or between two video feeds. It has a GUI made with QT to allow the user to toggle the parameters of the Feature extractors and descriptors in real time, and to change from extractor to extractor. This allows for quick testing of different Computer Vision algorithms in real time on different sets of images, without the user having to enter any code.
